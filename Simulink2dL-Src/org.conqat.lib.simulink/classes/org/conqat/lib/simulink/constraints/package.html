This package contains the constraints for the Simulink model. These 
constraints fall in two categories:

<ul>
<li><em>Mandatory Constraints</em>: These constraints must be satisfied
for a model to work properly. Due to technical reasons these constraints
cannot be checked during model build.</li>
<li><em>Optional Constraints</em>: Optional constraints are constraints
that are valid for actual Simulink models but must not be satisfied for
the Simulink library to work. An example is a constraints that requires
line not to cross subsystem boundaries. This is required in Simulink
but this library allows subsystem flattening and thereby cross-subsystem
lines.</li>
</ul>
