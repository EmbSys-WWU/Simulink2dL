/**
 * This is a wrapper for a {@link Set} prohibiting all calls which would modify
 * its contents. As the construction of this class is performed in constant time
 * it is prefered over copying the set (which takes linear time). Using this
 * class is also preferred to using the <code>unmodifiableX()</code> in class
 * {@link Collections} as they return the collection base type that does not
 * signal, that the object ist unmodifiable. Using the classes in this package
 * makes unmodifiability more explicit.
 * <p>
 * All prohibited methods throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}. The
 * class is nearly the same as the one returned by
 * {@link Collections#unmodifiableSet(java.util.Set)}, but by making it a public
 * class we can make the return value of some methods more explicit.
