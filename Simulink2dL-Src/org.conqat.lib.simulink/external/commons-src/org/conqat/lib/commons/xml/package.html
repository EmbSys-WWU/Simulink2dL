This package defines a simple, lean framework for writing and reading
XML files. This is by no means a complete persistance or XML publishing
framework but only a very thin abstraction layer on top of DOM/SAX to
enable a cleaner, redundancy-free and better modularized way of XML
processing.
<p>

The core of the framework is defined by the classes {@link 
org.conqat.lib.commons.xml.XMLWriter} and {@link 
org.conqat.lib.commons.xml.XMLReader}. Please have a look at the examples in test-src folder for further documentation.
