/**
 * Base class for SAX parser handlers. This class has a default implementation
 * of {@link #resolveEntity(String, String)} that works around a bug in the Java
 * SAX parser implementation:
 * 
 * If {@link #resolveEntity(String, String)} returns <code>null</code> for a
 * given DTD (the default behavior of {@link DefaultHandler}), the Java SAX
 * parser will try to download that DTD. This will fail on machines that have no
 * Internet connection or require a proxy to access the Internet or for DTDs
 * where the URI is not a valid URL. This class' default implementation instead
 * returns an empty {@link InputSource}, which effectively causes the parser to
 * skip DTD validation.
 * 
 * Please note that downloading the DTD from the Internet is against the DTD
 * specification (as the DTD URI is not required to be a valid URL) and is
 * highly error-prone, resulting in a hard to interpret error message. It is
 * thus recommended you use this base class and never return <code>null</code>
 * from {@link #resolveEntity(String, String)}.
