/**
 * A class that helps to convert between line numbers and character offsets. The
 * character offset is zero based while the line number is one based.
 * <p>
 * This class works for strings with arbitrary line terminators.
 * <p>
 * The implementation works by storing all character offsets of the newline
 * characters. For multi-character line endings (i.e. CR+LF on windows) the last
 * offset is stored. For space/performance reasons, these offsets are stored in
 * a bare array, which is managed by the base class.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note:</i> This class extends {@link ManagedIntArray} although delegation
 * would be more elegant. The problem, however, is, that {@link ManagedIntArray}
 * does not support delegation. The idea of this class was to provide protected
 * access to its internals, which only works via inheritance. Actually, this is
 * not interface inheritance ({@link ManagedIntArray} has no public method,
 * btw.) but implementation inheritance.
