 * A class containing an int array that is managed in the sense that it can grow
 * dynamically (using exponential growth). It is useful for cases where an
 * ArrayList<Integer> seems like overkill due to the high memory footprint of
 * the Integer objects and the amount of work performed for auto (un)boxing.
 * Note however, that a subclass has full access to the internals and thus might
 * cause chaos.
