 * have map semantics (i.e. information can get lost).
 * <p>
 * Implementations are not required to deal with synchronization. This has to be
 * handled by the caller.
 * 
 * @param <K>
 *            the key type. This must have both {@link Object#equals(Object)}
 *            and {@link Object#hashCode()} correctly implemented.
 * 
 * @param <V>
 *            the value type. It is generally recommended to use an immutable
 *            type here, but this is not required.
